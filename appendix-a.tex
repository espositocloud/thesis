\chapter{Golang}\label{golang}

The Go Programming Language, as known as \emph{Golang}, covers a
relevant role since it's the core of the vast majority of the software
adopted, and in some ways, it could be considered a requirement which
let to containers. (Even if this project and been developed without
writing a single line of code of Go.)

Golang is a recent language developed at Google in 2007, it's atypical
since it join traditional low-level language, like compiled and static
typing with high-level language, such as garbage collector and
high-level productivity, and add modern privitives such as concurrency
and vast standard library for web related topics. The result of the Go
compiler generate is a binary without external dependencies, relatively
fast in running, so once a software has been compiled for an
\emph{linux/amd64} operating system/architecture, it could be launched
on every (modern) GNU/Linux distributions for desktop or server where a
Go environment in totally absent.

So it's very easy straightforward deploying applications written in Go.

In addition it's strong opinionated on conventions, standardization and
built-in tools in order to improve team productivity, including testing,
linting, trans-compiling and other tools, so it feel good in companies.

Also dependencies of application are usually embedded inside the project
itself (today is done via \emph{godep}, a third-party tool), and
manually updated, so there is no the dependency hell, a common problems
of many low-level or high-level languages.
