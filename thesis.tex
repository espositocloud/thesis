\ringraziamenti
First of all I'd like to thanks my family and friends for supporting me, but also for endurance, during all these years.

In particular I'd like to thanks my parents to whom I dedicated this thesis, for giving me the opportunity to follow this educational path.

I thank Luca Ferroni for believing in me more than I've believed myself, and the whole beFair team for chasing wonderful goals every day.

I thank Michele Sorcinelli for being a faithful partner of studies and of first hacks on GNU/Linux systems.

Finally I'd like to thank the individuals, communities and companies actively develop and promote free software projects or adopt and spread sharing economy practices, locally or worldwide.
